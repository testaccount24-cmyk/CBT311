 Types of files in member $INDEX

 - PDS Unload...Contains input to utilities IEBUPDTE (IBM) or
                PDSLOAD (CBT tape).  I recommend using PDSLOAD for the
                ISPF stats.  The PDSLOAD program  can be found at

                   http://www.cbttape.org/ftp/cbt/CBT093.zip

                See sample job $PDSLOAD for doing this via PDSLOAD

 - Text.........Just plain text

 - TSO xmit.....This member is in TSO TRANSMIT format so that the
                variable blocked source could be transferred in a
                LRECL=80 file.  You will need to copy this dataset to a
                LRECL=80 BLKSIZE=80 RECFM=F file and then use this
                command to retrieve the members:

                   RECEIVE INDATASET(CBTxxx.FILE311.PDS(member))

                Hint: In ISPF 3.4, you can do this:

                   RECEIVE INDATASET(/(member))
